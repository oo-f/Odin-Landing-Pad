# Odin-Landing-Pad
TOP (The Odin Project) landing pad project

This project will test all my knowledge up to this point. Using css and html to
make a landing page. Flex boxes are my most recent skill and will be the most
challenging part. I will be committing frequently to ensure a clear roadmap of 
the project.

This landing page will consist of 6 parts. 
The header, four main body sections and the footer. There will be a nav bar 
in the header and links in the footer, with content throughout each body section. 
Making good use of flex containers/flex items to have a dynamic and cohesive landing 
page. And using css to style.

As an little bonus ill have the footer links tied to an about and contact page.
